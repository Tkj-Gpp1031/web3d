# web3d
assigment require
To meet these assignment requirements a successful student is required to build an X3D based Coca Cola Branded (3D App) exploiting HTML5, CSS3, X3D (X3DOM), 
JavaScript (you should utilise one or more of the JavaScript APIs such as jQuery, and a JavaScript frontend framework, e.g. Bootstrap),
AJAX for asynchronous update of HTML contents, JSON for data transfer from the backend to the frontend, PHP to access data from a SQLite database,
and all configured in an MVC design pattern. You should refine your Lab 3D Models to improve their geometry, materials, lighting and camera definition
. Your 3D models should be accessed through your Coca Cola Branded User Interface allowing them to be manipulated in 3D space.



In this project, I referenced code from feedback sites and made changes,
and I actively followed the open source community's specifications to detail the changes and enhancements I made. 
I believe that clear documentation and good code comments help others to understand the changes I have made and
how I have used them to achieve the goals of the project. Reference:
X3DOM open source project: http://www.x3dom.org/
